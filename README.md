<h1 align="center">EarlyGame</h1>
<p align="center">A 1.16.2 Fabric mod focusing on changing early game aspects to make the game feel more "realistic". This mod is currently in the alpha state so expect incomplete features.</p>

## Background
This idea revolves around the fact that as of this writing, no such mods for early game realism are present in the Fabric mod database. Moreover, it was inspired by three particular Forge mods that have the same premise, namely [No Tree Punching (1.12.2/1.15.2)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/no-tree-punching), [Natural Progression (1.14.4/1.15.2)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/natural-progressions), and [TerraFirmaCraft (1.12.2)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tfcraft) mods. Then I thought, "Fine, I'll do it myself."

## Features
### Current
- Removed the most beloved early game feature: punching trees.
- Along with this, stone and wood materials cannot be broken without a proper tool.
- Rocks and sticks are scattered around the world to help you progress.
- Andesite, granite and diorite rock and cobblestone variants complement with stone variants.
- Flint can be knapped on the stone surface to create flint shards.
- Flint shards can then be crafted into makeshift tools:
    - Flint knife can be used as a weapon, and to harvest plant fiber that can be crafted into lashing, which is important for the next tools to be crafted.
    - Flint axe can be used to chop trees, and to convert a log into a set of planks (WIP).
    - Flint pickaxe is tiered exactly with wooden tools for you to be able to mine copper ores.
- Oh, and speaking of which, there's a new mineral: copper!
- Copper tools are tiered exactly with stone tools to make it useful for those who use stone tools a lot.
- Copper armor can be crafted for a small but right amount of protection.
### Planned
- Saws to convert logs into 4 sets of wooden planks, and planks into sticks.
- Removal of vanilla wooden and stone tool recipes

## Dependencies
- **Fabric API** (0.20.1 build 401-1.16 and above)

## Issues
All incompatibilities and bugs can be reported in the [issues](https://github.com/JayCeeCreates/earlygame/issues) section.

## Credits
- **BoogieMonster1O1** (a great help for the code)
- **You** (for playing with this mod!)

### Any plans for a Forge version?
A Forge version of this particular mod is not necessary. I recommend the three aforementioned mods if you want a Forge experience.
