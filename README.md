<h1 align="center">EarlyGame</h1>
<p align="center">A 1.16.3 Fabric mod focusing on changing early game aspects to make the game feel more "realistic". This mod is currently in the very early alpha state so expect some broken and incomplete features.</p>

## Background
This idea revolves around the fact that as of this writing, no such mods for early game realism are present in the Fabric mod database. Then I thought, "Fine, I'll do it myself." Moreover, it was inspired by two particular Forge mods that have the same premise, namely [No Tree Punching (1.12.2/1.15.2)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/no-tree-punching) and [Natural Progression (1.14.4/1.15.2)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/natural-progressions).

## Features
### Current
- Removed the most beloved early game feature: punching trees.
- Along with this, stone and wood materials cannot be broken without a proper tool.
- Rocks and sticks are scattered around the world to help you progress.
- Andesite, granite and diorite rock and cobblestone variants complement with stone variants.
- You cannot craft wooden and stone tools.
- Vanilla crafting for planks and sticks are also disabled.
- Flint can be knapped on the stone surface to create flint shards.
- Flint shards can then be crafted into makeshift tools such as a knife, pickaxe, axe, and saw.
- There's a new mineral: copper!
- Copper tools are tiered exactly with stone tools to make it useful for those who use stone tools a lot.
- Copper armor can be crafted for a small but right amount of protection.
- New tools are introduced as well: saws and knives!
### In consideration
- Taking damage from breaking wooden and stone materials with bare hands
- Rock generation underwater
- Mod configuration

## Dependencies
### Required
- **Fabric API** (0.22.0 build 408-1.16 and above)
### Optional
- **Roughly Enough Items**: for crafting new tools

## Known Issues
- Recipes such as copper and flint tools cannot be unlocked for some reason.
- Some crafting recipes in the vanilla crafting guide are rendered blank; accessing it causes a game crash.

Incompatibilities and bugs can be reported in the [issues](https://github.com/JayCeeCreates/earlygame/issues) section.

### Any plans for a Forge version?
A Forge version of this particular mod is not necessary. I recommend the two aforementioned mods if you want to play an early game mod on Forge.
